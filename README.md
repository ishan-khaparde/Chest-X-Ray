# Chest X Ray

This is an attempt to develop a Deep Convolutional Neural Network to diagnose the patient based on the X Ray image as input. The dataset can be found on kaggle. Link here : https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data

Preprocessing of the data involved removing multiple labels for images and retaining only one, so that the training data has one label per image ( The original problem has multiple labels per image ) 

Obtained an accuracy of 74.19% after training for a 150 epochs.
